    <h2>How to Make It</h2>
</div>
<div class="step" itemprop="recipeInstructions">

    <h3>Step 1 </h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 400°. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the onions with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and roast until softened, about 20 min.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise with the lemon juice. Gradually whisk in the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil and season with salt and pepper.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>In a large skillet, cook the bacon over moderately high heat until crisp. Drain on paper towels and break each strip in half.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Light a grill or preheat a grill pan. Form the ground meat into eight patties. Season generously with salt and pepper and brush with olive oil. Grill over moderately high heat until well-browned on the bottom, 5 minutes. Flip the burgers, mound the brie on top and grill for 4 minutes longer, until the cheese is slightly melted and the burgers are medium-rare.</p>
    <h3>Step 5 </h3>
    <p>Spread the lemon mayonnaise on the cut sides of the buns; set the burgers on the bottoms and top with the bacon and onions. Close the burgers and serve right away.</p>
