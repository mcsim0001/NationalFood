    <p>It is a worldwide famous dish. Of course, it is well-loved and praise mostly in Slavic countries, however, the simple Ukrainian dish is popular throughout Europe. The deruni (potatoes pancakes) is almost unvaried around Ukraine. Even Ukrainian classical writers gave credits to this dish, describing it in their literary works.
The traditional deruni is a second course. It is usually served with sour cream without side dish for dinner. Nevertheless, the deruni might be served for breakfast because it is an easy-to-cook dish so it doesn’t require lots of time and it can be cooked even by culinary rookies.
They say the deruni came from Belarus. However, the Ukrainian one differs from the Belarusian one. The main difference consists in using of meat in the Belarusian deruni. The traditional Ukrainian deruni are made only with potatoes. However the stuffing is admitted and depends on cookers’ imagination. The classical recipe doesn’t contain the filling.</p>
