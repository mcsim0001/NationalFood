    <p>Cottage cheese pancakes are national Ukrainian dish, with curd being its main ingredient. Many ask why curd pancakes are called 'cottage cheese pancakes'! The answer is simple: in Ukraine curd is commonly called cottage cheese, and from here the dish's name derives.
The main ingredients are curd (dry is the best), eggs and flour. The pancakes may be sweet or salted, with or without filling. Many housewives also add apples, dried fruits, raisins, nuts and other ingredients upon their taste. The main thing is that they go with curd.
There are two ways to cook cottage cheese pancakes: fry them on pan and bake them in oven. You may also stew fried pancakes in sour cream for a while - it'll make them more delicate.
Cottage cheese pancakes are usually served for breakfast with sour cream or jam.</p>
