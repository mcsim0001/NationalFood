    <h2>How to Make It</h2>
</div>
<div class="step" itemprop="recipeInstructions">

    <h3>Step 1 </h3>
    <p>Heat a cast-iron griddle until very hot. Layer the pickle slices on the bottom buns.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Without overworking the meat, loosely form it into 4 balls and place them on the griddle. Cook the meatballs over moderately high heat for 30 seconds. Using a sturdy large spatula, flatten each ball into a 5-inch round patty. Season the patties with salt and pepper and cook for 2 minutes, until well seared. Press a handful of sliced onions onto each patty. Using the spatula, carefully flip each burger so the onions are on the bottom. Top with the cheese and cook for 2 minutes. Cover with a roasting pan and cook just until the cheese is melted, 1 minute more. Transfer the burgers with the onions to the buns and sprinkle with umami dust. Top with the buns and serve.</p>
<h3>Chef's Notes</h3>
    <p>Umami Dust Use a spice grinder to pulse 3 tablespoons bonito flakes, 1/2 ounce crumbled dried kombu, and 1/2 ounce dried shitake mushrooms into a powder. Keep in a sealed jar at room temperature for up to 2 months. Makes 2 1/2 ounces.</p>
